### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer with a BSc in Computer Science from The University of Adelaide, Australia.

I mostly work with python and javascript, but enjoy learning new technologies all the time.
I have worked on many different projects, including a chatbot for security executives with [CREST](https://www.crest-centre.net/) and a phishing filter with [Firstwave](https://www.firstwavecloud.com/).

I like to travel and have done multiple bikepacking trips, including an [8500km journey](https://kierenfunk.com/balkans) across the balkans. Currently, I live in Vienna.

I'm currently working on [Broker Labz](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/broker-labz/dfkfohlgonmaefdndjidadkgialkflbe) but work on many different projects at the same time to keep learning and always engaged.
