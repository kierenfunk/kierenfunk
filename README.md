### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelancer, software developer and data analyst with a BSc in Computer Science from The University of Adelaide, Australia.

I mostly work with python and javascript, but enjoy learning new technologies all the time.
I have worked on many different projects, including a chatbot for security executives with [CREST](https://www.crest-centre.net/).

I like to travel and have done multiple bikepacking trips, including an [8500km journey](https://www.kierenfunk.com/cycling-balkans) across the balkans and a smaller [1825km journey](https://kierenfunk.com/cycling-west) across west Europe. Currently, I live in WrocÅ‚aw, Poland.
